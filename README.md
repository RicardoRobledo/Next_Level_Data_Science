- Supervised learning: classification vs. regression  
- Train-test split vs. cross-validation techniques  
- Sequential feature selection for housing price prediction  
- Managing model complexity with numeric features  
- One-hot encoding for categorical data  
- Interpreting coefficients in linear regression models  
- Polynomial regression for capturing non-linear relationships  

### II Skills for Better Modeling
- Building and using pipelines for data transformation  
- Detecting and overcoming perfect multicollinearity using Lasso regression  
- Feature scaling and optimizing penalized regression models  
- Comparative guide to imputation techniques: simple, iterative, and kNN imputation  

### III Tree-Based Models in Data Science
- Overview of tree-based regression models with visualization  
- Practical use of ordinal encoding with decision trees  
- Ensemble methods: bagging, random forests, and gradient boosting  
- Handling missing data and categorical features with XGBoost  
- Exploring LightGBM with leaf-wise growth strategies  
- Building robust home price prediction systems with CatBoost  

### IV The Data Science Mindset
- Planning data science projects: understanding data and defining goals  
- Feature selection and engineering for robust models  
- Evaluating and interpreting model performance  
- Communicating results through hypothesis testing and data narratives  

This notebook provides a comprehensive pathway for advancing data science skills, especially in regression and tree-based modeling, emphasizing practical implementation and model interpretation.
